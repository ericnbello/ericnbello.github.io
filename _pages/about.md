<section class="about-intro">
  <p>
    I’m a data analyst with a background in computer engineering and a strong foundation in analytical thinking and problem-solving.

  <!-- <h2></h2> -->
  <p>
   Over the past several years, I’ve worked independently on technical and analytical projects, including running a small business and doing freelance web development. These experiences strengthened my ability to work with real-world data, evaluate tradeoffs, and communicate clearly — especially when requirements are messy or evolving.
  </p>
  <p>
    Today, I focus on turning raw data into clear, practical insights. I enjoy digging into datasets, identifying patterns, and presenting findings in a way that supports better decisions.

<section class="about-section">
  <h2>Tools & Workflow</h2>
  <p>
    I primarily work with <strong>SQL</strong>, <strong>Excel</strong>, and <strong>Tableau</strong> to clean data, analyze trends, and build dashboards. I use SQL to query and transform data, Excel for analysis and validation, and Tableau to communicate insights visually.
  </p>
  <p>
    I also have experience with <strong>Python</strong> from my engineering background and use it selectively for data cleaning and exploration as I continue to refresh those skills.
