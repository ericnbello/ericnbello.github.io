I'm a data analyst with a background in computer engineering and a strong foundation in mathematics and problem-solving. Managing a small business taught me how to analyze trends, make informed decisions, and adapt to challenges, while freelancing as a web developer strengthened my technical skills and ability to manage complex projects. These experiences have shaped my analytical mindset and attention to detail.

Now, I focus on leveraging tools like Python (Pandas, NumPy), SQL, and Excel to uncover insights and deliver impactful solutions. Iâ€™m skilled in data visualization with Tableau, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, as well as data cleaning and transformation using relational databases. Proficient with tools like Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, Git, and AWS, I bring both technical expertise and cloud computing knowledge to every project. My passion lies in turning raw data into meaningful insights that drive decisions.
