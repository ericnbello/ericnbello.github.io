Understanding customer behavior is key to driving sales. In this project, I analyzed a **bike sales dataset** to identify **patterns in customer demographics**, helping businesses make data-driven decisions.

### Data Cleaning & Preparation  

Before diving into analysis, I cleaned the dataset:

- Standardized **income, age, and commute distance** values  
- Created **age brackets** to group customers into meaningful segments  
- Ensured **consistent formatting** across all data points  

### Key Insights & Visualizations  

Using **Excel pivot tables and slicers**, I created an interactive dashboard revealing:  
**Income vs. Bike Purchases** – Higher-income customers were more likely to buy bikes  
**Commute Distance Analysis** – People with **shorter commutes** tended to purchase more bikes  
**Education and Marital Status Trends** – Non-homeowners and those without cars showed higher bike purchase rates  

### Interactive Dashboard  

The final dashboard allows users to filter data based on:  

- **Marital Status**  
- **Education**  
- **Region**  

### Conclusion  

This project showcases **Excel’s powerful data analysis capabilities**. By using **pivot tables, charts, and slicers**, I turned raw data into actionable insights.
