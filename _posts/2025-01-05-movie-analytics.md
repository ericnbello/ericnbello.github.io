This project analyzes a dataset of over 5,000 movies to uncover insights into the factors that influence box office success. Using Python for data cleaning, transformation, and visualization, I explored how variables like budget, revenue, genre, and release date affect a movie’s performance.

**Highlights:**

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Parsed nested data structures, handled missing values, and formatted data types to prepare for analysis.
- **Visual Storytelling:** Used charts and graphs to showcase key relationships—such as how budget correlates with revenue, which genres dominate the market, and what time of year sees the most successful releases.
- **Trend Analysis:** Uncovered patterns in genre popularity, budget efficiency, and seasonal revenue shifts across the film industry.

**Technologies Used:**

- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- pandas  
- matplotlib  
- seaborn
