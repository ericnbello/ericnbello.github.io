This project showcases my skills in data integration, preprocessing, visualization, and cloud-based deployment, making it a comprehensive demonstration of my data analysis and technical capabilities.

### Key Features

- **Real-Time Data Processing:** Fetches and processes live weather data.
- **Interactive Data Visualizations:** Utilizes Plotly to display temperature trends, humidity forecast, and precipitation probabilities.
- **Serverless Cloud Hosting:** Deployed using AWS Lambda and S3 for a scalable and cost-efficient architecture.
- **Consolidated Dashboard:** Provides a unified view of weather insights through dynamic visualizations.

### Technologies Used

- **Python & AWS Lambda:** Backend development and serverless execution.
- **Plotly:** Interactive data visualization.
- **OpenWeather API:** Real-time data source.
- **AWS S3:** Hosting the frontend and managing static assets.
- **AWS Lambda:** Processing weather data without maintaining dedicated servers.

### Data Analysis & Visualization

A significant part of this project involved working with raw API data:

- **Data Cleaning:** Transformed raw JSON responses into structured datasets using Python.
- **Trend Analysis:** Created Plotly visualizations to analyze weather trends over time.
- **User Insights:** Enabled data-driven decision-making through clear, interactive charts.

### Deployment Architecture

- **AWS Lambda:** Handles backend data processing and API interactions.
- **AWS S3:** Hosts the frontend application for seamless access.
- **Data Pipeline:** Automates data retrieval and transformation for visualization.
