The rapid growth of IoT devices has led to an explosion of sensor data, offering unique opportunities for data-driven insights. In this post, I walk through a data analysis project where I utilized synthetic IoT sensor data to showcase skills in data manipulation, visualization, and analysis using Python.

### Project Overview

The project simulates sensor data from IoT devices, including temperature, humidity, and pressure readings over time. This dataset provided a perfect sandbox to apply statistical analysis and visualization techniques commonly used in real-world scenarios.

### Tools and Technologies

- **Python:** For data manipulation and analysis
- **Pandas:** Data cleaning and preprocessing
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** Data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook:** Interactive coding environment

### Key Steps in the Analysis

1. **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values and outliers to ensure data integrity.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualized trends and patterns using time series plots, histograms, and heatmaps.
3. **Statistical Analysis:** Identified correlations and trends to uncover actionable insights.

### Insights Gained

- Detected anomalies in temperature fluctuations, which could indicate faulty sensors.
- Identified correlations between humidity and temperature changes over different periods.
- Developed visualizations to showcase data trends.

### Conclusion

This project not only sharpened my data analysis skills but also demonstrated how IoT data can be transformed into meaningful insights. Check out the [full project here](https://github.com/ericnbello/sensor-analytics) to see the code and visualizations.
